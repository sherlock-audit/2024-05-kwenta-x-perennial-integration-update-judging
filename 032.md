# Unbounded loop in the _invoke function can lead to denial of service

## Summary

Looping over an array of unbounded size can lead to denial of service.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the MultiInvoker.sol contract the `function invoke(address account, Invocation[] calldata invocations) external`, which is meant to perform invocations for account,  calls `function _invoke(address account, Invocation[] calldata invocations) private` which Performs a batch of invocations for an account. To carry out this task the function loops through an unbounded array of type struct Invocation. However, If the length of the array of massive size such that the batch invocations of an account (which does involve different kinds of logic in the conditional statements) causes the block to reach its gas limit without the function been able to fully perform its set out objectives.

## Impact

This could lead to Ethereum-imposed gas constraint, making the entire transaction to reverts and users unable to interact with the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It will be ideal to determine the lenght of the array that the protocol would want to batch process at a given time without rendering the _invoke functionâ€™s operation too gas intensive; then, use that number as the upper limit on the number of data that would be processed by the _invoke function.
