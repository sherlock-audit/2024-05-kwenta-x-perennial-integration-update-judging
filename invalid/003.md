# Invoke functionality is bricked for users using relayers for transactions

## Summary
Users or theirs operators using relayers for invoking actions will not work.
## Vulnerability Detail
There can be scenarios when users  want to use relayers for some reasons like having the flexibility of `gasless meta-transactions` 
The `users` or `operators of users` might also use the relayers to benefit from the benefits the relayers provide when invoking certain actions through `invoke`. But the contract strictly checks if the `msg.sender` is the target `account` or `msg.sender` is the `operator` of the acccount , which will make the transaction revert as when the transaction is initiated from a relayer, the `relayer` itself becomes the `msg.sender`.

The code of `invoke` methods is as follows

```solidity
  /// @notice entry to perform invocations for msg.sender
    /// @param invocations List of actions to execute in order
    function invoke(Invocation[] calldata invocations) external payable {
        _invoke(msg.sender, invocations);
    }

    /// @notice entry to perform invocations for account
    /// @param account Account to perform invocations for
    /// @param invocations List of actions to execute in order
    function invoke(address account, Invocation[] calldata invocations) external payable {
        _invoke(account, invocations);
    }

        
```
which calls the internal `_invoke` method

```solidity
    function _invoke(address account, Invocation[] calldata invocations) private {
        if (msg.sender != account && !operators[account][msg.sender]) revert MultiInvokerUnauthorizedError();
    // SNIP ..
    }
```

The function requires that `msg.sender` has to be the `account` itself or `operator` of the account .
However in case of relayers use , msg.sender will be the relayer itself.

however it is not using `_msgSender()` which will fetch the transaction caller ( EOA ) who has initiated the transaction, rather it will bring the `relayer's address as msg.sender` reverting the transaction


## Impact Explanation
As msg.sender is not the transaction origin address (who is the actual account or operator,  initiating the transaction through relayer ), the transactions will fail for such users leaving to DoS to them for invokin functionalities.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `_msgSender()` rather than `msg.sender`

Here's why you should consider using this - [Complete Discussion - OZ Forum](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/why-use-msgsender-rather-than-msg-sender/4370/5)

Here is the simplest explanation by one of the guys in that discussion 

- For a normal transaction, `msgSender()` will simply give back `msg.sender` 

- For meta transactions `msgSender()` acts differently . 
- For example, 
      - `Address A` submits off-chain signed data to a relayer.
      - The relayer then submits the transaction on-chain to a `relayHub` contract
      - which in turn calls the target contract . `msgSender()` in this type of meta-transaction gives `address A`.
