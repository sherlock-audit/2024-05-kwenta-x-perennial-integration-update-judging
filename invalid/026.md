# Medium 01 DoS

## Summary
The code snippet implements a loop iterating over an array called invocations, storing each element in an Invocation struct. Our audit identified a potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability associated with this loop structure.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises due to the lack of constraint on the size of the invocations array. As the loop iterates over each element, it could consume excessive gas, potentially leading to a DoS attack if the array size is unbounded or excessively large.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-kwenta-x-perennial-integration-update/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L143-L188

## Impact
If exploited, the vulnerability could result in a DoS attack, causing the system to become unresponsive or exhaust gas resources, disrupting normal operations.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
for (uint i = 0; i < invocations.length; ++i) {
    Invocation memory invocation = invocations[i];
    // Further code handling invocation
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Implement Gas Limitations: Introduce gas limitations within the loop to prevent excessive gas consumption. Set a maximum gas allowance for each iteration or implement a gas stipend mechanism.
- Implement `_invokeOne` function for only one invocation: A function handling only one invocation on top of the already present `_invoke` function will decrease the usage of the vulnerable of DoS `_invoke` function.
- Consider Pagination or Chunking: If the array size could be arbitrarily large, implement pagination or chunking techniques to process the array in smaller portions, mitigating the risk of gas exhaustion and DoS attacks.
- Array Size Validation: Implement validation checks to ensure the size of the invocations array is within acceptable bounds before entering the loop. Enforce a maximum array size or validate the array size against predetermined thresholds.
- Gas Estimation and Monitoring: Continuously monitor gas consumption during testing and production. Implement gas estimation techniques to anticipate potential gas usage spikes and assess the impact of loop iterations on overall gas consumption.
