# [H-01] No check in the `initialize` function if Arbitrum L2 sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds

## Summary
Optimistic rollup protocols move all execution off the layer 1 (L1) Ethereum chain, complete execution on a layer 2 (L2) chain, and return the results of the L2 execution back to the L1. These protocols have a [sequencer](https://community.optimism.io/docs/protocol/2-rollup-protocol/) that executes and rolls up the L2 transactions by batching multiple transactions into a single transaction.

If a sequencer becomes unavailable, it is impossible to access read/write APIs that consumers are using and applications on the L2 network will be down for most users without interacting directly through the L1 optimistic rollup contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail
`ethOracle_` is used to initialize the contract butthere is no check that the sequencer is down: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-kwenta-x-perennial-integration-update/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L84C1-L94C6

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability could be significant, as it may result in failure to  to set up necessary permissions for interacting with other contracts (like DSU, USDC tokens, batcher contract etc.) and setup some initial state for the MultiInvoker contract itself on the L2 network if the sequencer goes offline. Users may experience disruptions in accessing read/write APIs, potentially causing inconvenience or financial loss.

```solidity

 function initialize(AggregatorV3Interface ethOracle_)
        external
        initializer(1)
    {
        __Kept__initialize(ethOracle_, DSU);

        if (address(batcher) != address(0)) {
            DSU.approve(address(batcher));
            USDC.approve(address(batcher));
        }

        DSU.approve(address(reserve));
        USDC.approve(address(reserve));
    }
