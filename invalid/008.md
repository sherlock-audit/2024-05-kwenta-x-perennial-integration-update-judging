# Unprotected updateOperator function

## Summary
The updateOperator function allows any address to update the operator status for another address. This function is not protected by any access modifiers or checks, which means that an attacker can update the operator status for any address, potentially leading to unauthorized access.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
An attacker can call the updateOperator function to set themselves as an operator for a target address, allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the target address.

## Code Snippet
function updateOperator(address operator, bool newEnabled) external {
        operators[msg.sender][operator] = newEnabled;
        emit OperatorUpdated(msg.sender, operator, newEnabled);
    }
