# Medium 03 Improper Handling of Accounts in _commitPrice

## Summary
The function `_commitPrice` charges a fee to `msg.sender` even when it is called for another account through `_invoke`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the implementation of `_commitPrice`, which does not properly handle the fee charging mechanism when called for another account via `_invoke`. It always charges the fee to the caller (`msg.sender`) instead of the account it is being operated for.
Also, it fully ignores that it is called for another account.

## Impact
This behaviour can result in financial losses for the caller (`msg.sender`) as they are unfairly charged fees for actions performed on behalf of another account. It may also lead to exploitation if the caller is not aware of this discrepancy.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
_commitPrice(oracleProviderFactory, value, ids, version, data, revertOnFailure);
```
The fee is charged here:
```solidity
// Return through keeper fee if any
DSU.push(msg.sender, DSU.balanceOf().sub(balanceBefore));
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The function `_commitPrice` should be modified to charge fees to the appropriate account it is being operated for, rather than always charging fees to `msg.sender`.

Also, the account property should be passed as it is shown below:
```solidity
function _commitPrice(
address account,
address oracleProviderFactory,
uint256 value,
bytes32[] memory ids,
uint256 version,
bytes memory data,
bool revertOnFailure
) internal {
	// Rest of function
}
```

And the call to the function should be modified:
```solidity
_commitPrice(account, oracleProviderFactory, value, ids, version, data, revertOnFailure);
```
