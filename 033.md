# Keeper Fees can not be raised or changed

## Summary
Keeper Fees can not be raised or changed

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_raiseKeeperFee` is an internal function and is not being called anywhere to update the Keeper Fees 

## Impact
The keeper Fees can not be raised or changed. This can lead to losing a Keeper because of low Keeper Fees.
Costs more gas if not used.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
     function _raiseKeeperFee(UFixed18 keeperFee, bytes memory data) internal virtual override returns (UFixed18) {
        (address account, IMarket market, UFixed6 fee) = abi.decode(data, (address, IMarket, UFixed6));
        UFixed6 raisedKeeperFee = UFixed6Lib.from(keeperFee, true).min(fee);
        _marketWithdraw(market, account, raisedKeeperFee);

        return UFixed18Lib.from(raisedKeeperFee);
    }

```
