# High 01 Ownership Check Missing

## Summary
The `initialize` function in the contract lacks an ownership check, allowing anyone to call it.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `initialize` function can be called by anyone without an ownership check, potentially leading to unauthorized changes to the contract state.

## Impact
This vulnerability could allow malicious actors to manipulate the contract's state or configuration, leading to unexpected behaviour or loss of funds.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function initialize(AggregatorV3Interface ethOracle_) external initializer(1) {
    __Kept__initialize(ethOracle_, DSU);

    if (address(batcher) != address(0)) {
        DSU.approve(address(batcher));
        USDC.approve(address(batcher));
    }

    DSU.approve(address(reserve));
    USDC.approve(address(reserve));
}
```

### Possible Attack-Vector
If someone was to call `initialize` setting a malicious Oracle, the `_commitPrice` function becomes a major vulnerability as it calls `IPythFactory(oracleProviderFactory).commit{ value: value }(ids, version, data)` exposing the contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement an ownership check in the `initialize` function to ensure that only authorized parties can initialise the contract.

For example the contract can inherit `Ownable.sol` and the function will be modified to:
```solidity
function initialize(AggregatorV3Interface ethOracle_) external initializer(1) onlyOwner {
    __Kept__initialize(ethOracle_, DSU);

    if (address(batcher) != address(0)) {
        DSU.approve(address(batcher));
        USDC.approve(address(batcher));
    }

    DSU.approve(address(reserve));
    USDC.approve(address(reserve));
}
```
