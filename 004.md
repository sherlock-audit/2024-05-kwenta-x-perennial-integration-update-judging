# _deposit function's implementation contradicts with its Natspec

## Summary
The protocol , in contest readme , states that they will accept the issues related to functions contradicting their natspec.
_deposit is such function which according to Natspec has to pull funds from `msg.sender` but in current implementation , 
it pulls funds from `account` which poses the risk of broken assumptions
## Vulnerability Detail
When a person calls invoke , the update method is called internally

which in turn calls the _deposit method to pull funds

The Natspec of _deposit funds stats that

However , the implementation does not pull funds from the `msg.sender`, rather funds are pulled from `account`.

The protocol has assumed that `msg.sender` is always the account but let me take you back to  _invoke method

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-kwenta-x-perennial-integration-update/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L141

We can clearly see that `msg.sender` can also be an operator.

The protocol might has to pull funds from the operator but instead pulling funds always from the `account` which can lead to following impact

## Impact
Broken assumptions and pulling funds always from target account instead of msg.sender can break future integrations that 

thinks the funds will be pulled from msg.sender and not the passed account

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Correctly pull funds from `msg.sender` or update the Natspec of the function to prevent future integration issues
