# loss of eth when  you cancel the order

## Summary
loss of eth when  you cancel the order

## Vulnerability Detail
when a user calls `_cancelOrder` their account gets deleted https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-kwenta-x-perennial-integration-update/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L447

The user does not get back the eth they sent to the contract when they call `invoke` when they cancel Orders

## Impact
loss of eth. Users not getting back the eth they sent to the contract

```solidity
   
   function _cancelOrder(address account, IMarket market, uint256 nonce) internal {
        delete _orders[account][market][nonce];
        emit OrderCancelled(account, market, nonce);
    }
```

## Tool used

## Recommendation

Add a mapping state variable to store how much each user sends to the contract and send that value  back to the user when they 
Cancel Orders.
