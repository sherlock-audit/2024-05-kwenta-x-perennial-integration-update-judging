# `_invoke` will revert if the amount remaining is less than the gas required for the transaction.

## Summary
`_invoke` will revert if the amount remaining is less than the gas required for the transaction.
## Vulnerability Detail
As clearly mentioned in the docs:
![image](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-kwenta-x-perennial-integration-update-maushish/assets/114429859/ab8d02ed-33b1-429b-8ad6-49c3246d334a)
During invocations performed by `invoke` the last functionality is to send the remaining **ETH** back to the `account` 

```solidity

        // ETH must not remain in this contract at rest
        Address.sendValue(payable(account), address(this).balance);
    }
```

Due to the high volatility of markets, here lies a critical scenario in which the contract balance could be lower than the gas fees required to send the transaction, in which case `_invoke` might get executed but `account` will pay more **ETH**, and this excessive **ETH** would be transferred to the next caller of the 'invoke'.
## Impact
Some users won't get any **ETH** back, while others might get more than originally calculated.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Have a mechanism which tracks all failed txns of `_invoke` with the corresponding amounts and addresses.
- Have an `ADMIN` only function that can be used to transfer the reverted txns excess **ETH** back to the accounts.
