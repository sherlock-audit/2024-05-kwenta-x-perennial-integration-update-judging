# `vaultUpdate` function calculates wrong claimAmount for user

## Summary

`_vaultUpdate` claimAmount calculation isnt correctly handling an  edgecase situation ,might cause the claimAmount to be incorrect and not expected value by the user.

## Vulnerability Detail

in the `vaultUpdate` function 

```solidity

  function _vaultUpdate(
        address account,
        IVault vault,
        UFixed6 depositAssets,
        UFixed6 redeemShares,
        UFixed6 claimAssets,
        bool wrap
    ) internal isVaultInstance(vault) {
        if (!depositAssets.isZero()) {
            _deposit(account, depositAssets, wrap);
        }

        UFixed18 balanceBefore = DSU.balanceOf();

        vault.update(account, depositAssets, redeemShares, claimAssets);

        // handle socialization, settlement fees, and magic values
        UFixed6 claimAmount = claimAssets.isZero() ?
            UFixed6Lib.ZERO :
            UFixed6Lib.from(DSU.balanceOf().sub(balanceBefore));

        if (!claimAmount.isZero()) {
            _withdraw(account, claimAmount, wrap);
        }
    }

```

The value of `claimAmount` is calculated based on the difference between the balance of DSU after and before the Vault updation.However during an edge case scenario where a user might only deposit a verylow amount of DSU and tries to claim a fairly large amount of asset from the vault.This causes the the balances of before and after to astate where the balance before is greater than the balances now.This case is not well addressed .Hence causing wrong claimamount calculation for the user.

## Impact

User might not get the desired claimAmount in returns,or even drive the system to be in an unexpected state
