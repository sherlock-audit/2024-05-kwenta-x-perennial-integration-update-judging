# Unconditional ETH Transfer After Potential Invocation Failures

## Summary
The _invoke function risks sending the entire ETH balance to a designated account even if some invocations within the function fail.
## Vulnerability Detail
 The function iterates through a list of Invocation structs and executes the corresponding action based on the action field.
After the loop completes, the code unconditionally sends the entire ETH balance of the contract to the specified account using Address.sendValue.
The problem arises if any of the invocations within the loop revert due to errors. While the remaining invocations won't be executed, the ETH transfer will still happen.
## Impact
- Unexpected behavior: The account might receive ETH despite failed actions.
- Loss of funds: The contract could lose ETH due to failed invocations.

```solidity
function _invoke(address account, Invocation[] calldata invocations) private {

  +  bool allSucceeded = true; // Flag to track if all invocations succeed

  // ... loop iterating through invocations ...

    // If any invocation failed, revert and don't transfer ETH balance
  +  if (!allSucceeded) {
  +     revert("One or more invocations failed");
  +  }

    // Transfer ETH balance only if all invocations succeeded
    Address.sendValue(payable(account), address(this).balance);

}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Track invocation success with a boolean flag (allSucceeded). Transfer ETH only if all invocations succeed. This prevents unintended fund loss.
